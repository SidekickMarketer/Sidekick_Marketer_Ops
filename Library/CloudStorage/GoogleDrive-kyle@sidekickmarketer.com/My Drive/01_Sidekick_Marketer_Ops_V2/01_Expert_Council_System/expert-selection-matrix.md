## Red Flags in Expert Application

❌ **Generic "best practices"** → Need specific expert framework
❌ **Single perspective** → Need multiple expert views
❌ **No mental models** → Must apply frameworks
❌ **Surface-level application** → Must go deep
❌ **Conflicting advice** → Reconcile or choose

---

## The Expert Council Effect

When multiple experts agree = **High confidence**
When experts disagree = **Important nuance**
When no expert applies = **Gap in knowledge**

### Example: Pricing Decision
- Hermann Simon says: "1% price increase = 11% profit"
- Ron Baker says: "Price the client, not the service"
- Dan Ariely says: "Use anchoring and decoys"
- Blair Enns says: "Three options, make middle attractive"
**Result**: Premium pricing with psychological optimization

## Remember

**Experts are not just names to drop.**
They are frameworks to channel.

Every agent should ask:
"What would [Expert] do here?"
"How would [Expert] think about this?"
"What would [Expert] never do?"

This is the difference between AI and Expert-AI.
