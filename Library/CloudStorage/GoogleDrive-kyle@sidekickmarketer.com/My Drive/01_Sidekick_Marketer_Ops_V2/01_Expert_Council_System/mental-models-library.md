## Critical Thinking Frameworks for Agent Intelligence

## Charlie Munger's Top 25 Mental Models

### 1. **Inversion**
"Invert, always invert. Turn a situation upside down."
- **Application**: Instead of "how to succeed," ask "how to guarantee failure"
- **Agent Use**: Discovery agents identify what would destroy the business

### 2. **Circle of Competence**
"Know what you know and know what you don't know."
- **Application**: Stay within expertise boundaries
- **Agent Use**: Agents recognize when to call other agents

### 3. **Opportunity Cost**
"Every action has a cost of the next best alternative."
- **Application**: Prioritize highest-value activities
- **Agent Use**: Task_Prioritizer weighs all options

### 4. **Compound Interest**
"The most powerful force in the universe."
- **Application**: Small improvements compound over time
- **Agent Use**: Focus on recurring value generation

### 5. **Probabilistic Thinking**
"Think in terms of probabilities, not certainties."
- **Application**: Weight decisions by likelihood × impact
- **Agent Use**: Predictive agents calculate confidence levels

### 6. **Hanlon's Razor**
"Never attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence."
- **Application**: Assume mistakes over manipulation
- **Agent Use**: Customer service agents default to empathy

### 7. **Occam's Razor**
"The simplest explanation is usually correct."
- **Application**: Start with simple solutions
- **Agent Use**: Debugging agents test simple fixes first

### 8. **Second-Order Thinking**
"Consider the consequences of consequences."
- **Application**: Think multiple steps ahead
- **Agent Use**: Strategy agents model ripple effects

### 9. **The Map is Not the Territory**
"Models are simplifications of reality."
- **Application**: Remember all models have limitations
- **Agent Use**: Agents update models based on real results

### 10. **Incentives**
"Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome."
- **Application**: Align incentives with desired outcomes
- **Agent Use**: Pricing agents consider buyer incentives

## First Principles Thinking

### Elon Musk's Approach
"Boil things down to fundamental truths and reason up from there."

**Steps**:
1. Identify and define current assumptions
2. Break down the problem into fundamental principles
3. Create new solutions from scratch

**Agent Application**:
- Problem-solving agents start from basics
- Innovation agents ignore "how it's always done"
- Cost reduction agents question every expense

---

## Systems Thinking Models

### 1. **Feedback Loops**
- Positive (reinforcing)
- Negative (balancing)
- **Agent Use**: Monitor and adjust based on results

### 2. **Bottlenecks**
"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link."
- **Agent Use**: Identify and fix constraining factors

### 3. **Network Effects**
"Value increases with more users."
- **Agent Use**: Build solutions that get better with scale

### 4. **Emergence**
"The whole is greater than the sum of parts."
- **Agent Use**: Agents working together create unexpected value

### 5. **Antifragility**
"Systems that gain from disorder."
- **Agent Use**: Build agents that improve from failures

---

## Decision-Making Frameworks

### 1. **Eisenhower Matrix**
```
Urgent + Important = Do First
Not Urgent + Important = Schedule
Urgent + Not Important = Delegate
Not Urgent + Not Important = Eliminate
```
**Agent Use**: Task_Prioritizer sorts all tasks

### 2. **OODA Loop**
- Observe
- Orient
- Decide
- Act
**Agent Use**: Real-time decision agents

### 3. **Pareto Principle (80/20)**
"80% of results from 20% of effort"
**Agent Use**: Focus on high-impact activities

### 4. **Regret Minimization**
"Project yourself to 80 and minimize regrets"
**Agent Use**: Long-term decision making

## Psychology & Behavior Models

### Cognitive Biases to Account For:

1. **Confirmation Bias**
- Seeking confirming evidence
- **Agent Mitigation**: Always seek disconfirming evidence

2. **Anchoring Bias**
- Over-relying on first information
- **Agent Mitigation**: Multiple data points before deciding

3. **Availability Heuristic**
- Overweighting recent/memorable events
- **Agent Mitigation**: Use complete historical data

4. **Dunning-Kruger Effect**
- Incompetent overconfidence
- **Agent Mitigation**: Continuous validation and testing

5. **Loss Aversion**
- Losses feel worse than equivalent gains
- **Agent Mitigation**: Frame in terms of gains

6. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**
- Continuing due to past investment
- **Agent Mitigation**: Ignore past costs in decisions

## Business Strategy Models

### Porter's Five Forces
1. Competitive rivalry
2. Supplier power
3. Buyer power
4. Threat of substitution
5. Threat of new entry

**Agent Use**: Competitive analysis agents

### BCG Matrix
- Stars (High growth, High share)
- Cash Cows (Low growth, High share)
- Question Marks (High growth, Low share)
- Dogs (Low growth, Low share)

**Agent Use**: Portfolio management agents

### Jobs-to-be-Done
"People don't buy products; they hire them to do a job."
**Agent Use**: Product development agents

---

## Innovation Models

### The Innovation S-Curve
- Slow initial growth
- Rapid acceleration
- Plateau at maturity
**Agent Use**: Timing market entry

### Crossing the Chasm
- Innovators → Early Adopters → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards
**Agent Use**: Market penetration strategy

### Blue Ocean Strategy
- Create uncontested market space
- Make competition irrelevant
**Agent Use**: Differentiation agents

---

## Risk Management Models

### Black Swan Theory
"Rare but extreme impact events"
**Agent Use**: Contingency planning

### Margin of Safety
"The difference between intrinsic value and price"
**Agent Use**: Conservative estimates

### Barbell Strategy
"90% super safe, 10% super risky"
**Agent Use**: Portfolio balance

---

## Learning & Growth Models

### Deliberate Practice
"Focused practice with immediate feedback"
**Agent Use**: Agent improvement cycles

### Growth Mindset
"Abilities can be developed through dedication"
**Agent Use**: Continuous improvement

### The Learning Curve
"Efficiency improves with experience"
**Agent Use**: Track agent performance over time

## How Agents Apply Mental Models

### Example: Discovery_Synthesizer_Agent

```python
def apply_mental_models(discovery_data):
    # Inversion
    failure_modes = identify_what_destroys_business(discovery_data)
    
    # Second-order thinking
    consequences = map_consequence_chains(discovery_data)
    
    # 80/20 principle
    critical_few = find_20_percent_driving_80(discovery_data)
    
    # Incentive analysis
    stakeholder_incentives = map_all_incentives(discovery_data)
    
    # Systems thinking
    feedback_loops = identify_reinforcing_cycles(discovery_data)
    
    return synthesized_insights
```

## The Power of Combined Models

**Lollapalooza Effect**: When multiple models point same direction
- Example: Pricing decision using:
  - Psychology (anchoring)
  - Economics (supply/demand)
  - Competition (positioning)
  - Incentives (buyer motivation)
  = Optimal price point

## Remember

"To the man with only a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

Your agents have 100+ tools. Use them wisely.
