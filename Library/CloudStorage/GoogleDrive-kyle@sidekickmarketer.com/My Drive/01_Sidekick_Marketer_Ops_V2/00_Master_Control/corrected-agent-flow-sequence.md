## We Need to Fix Our Agents!

### Current Issue:
**SOW_Generator_Agent is in wrong place!**

### Should Be:
1. **Proposal_Builder** (Agent 008) - Already exists ✅
2. **Contract_Generator** - MISSING! Need to create ❌
3. **SOW_Generator** - Move to POST-contract ⚠️

### The Fix:
- Rename/repurpose SOW_Generator for post-contract
- Ensure Proposal_Builder has everything for winning
- Add Contract_Generator_Agent (new critical agent)

## Updated Critical Path

```mermaid

    A[Discovery] --> B[Synthesis]
    B --> C[PROPOSAL]
    C --> D{Client Decision}
    D -->|Yes| E[CONTRACT]
    E --> F[SOW]
    F --> G[Onboarding]
    D -->|No| H[Nurture Sequence]
```

## Key Takeaway

**You caught a critical error!**

- **Proposal** = Sales document (wins business)
- **Contract** = Legal document (protects both)
- **SOW** = Execution document (details work)

Most agencies confuse these. You won't!

Should we create a Contract_Generator_Agent to fill this gap?
