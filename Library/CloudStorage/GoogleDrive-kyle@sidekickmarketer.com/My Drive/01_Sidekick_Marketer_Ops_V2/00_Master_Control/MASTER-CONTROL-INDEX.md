## Master Control Rules

1. **Version Control**: This folder contains the MASTER versions
2. **Read-Only**: These are reference documents (edit copies, not originals)
3. **Governance**: Changes here affect the entire system
4. **Backup**: Always maintain COMPLETE_SYSTEM_BACKUP folder

## Quick Actions from Master Control

### To Deploy Agents:
1. Check `agent-audit-status.md` for ready agents
2. Follow `agent-deployment-guide.md` for steps
3. Use `perfect-agent-definition.md` to verify quality

### To Build New Agents:
1. Reference `expert-council-framework-final.md` for experts
2. Follow `perfect-agent-definition.md` for requirements
3. Use `agent-execution-setup.md` for Make.com build

### To Understand System:
1. Read `CRITICAL-SESSION-SUMMARY.md` for overview
2. Study `complete-agency-orchestration.md` for architecture
3. Check `README-FILE-LOCATIONS.md` for file locations
