## 🔄 Self-Evolution in Action

The Pattern Detection Engine will:

1. **Monitor continuously** for inefficiencies
2. **Detect patterns** across all data streams
3. **Calculate impact** and confidence scores
4. **Auto-create agents** when thresholds met
5. **Deploy immediately** if confidence >85%
6. **Learn and improve** from results
